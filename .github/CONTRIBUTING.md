# Tone Rooms Presets Contributing Guide

Hi! I'm very excited that you are interested in contributing to this repo. First of all, those are my personal presets, so I'm really glad you want to change them or add your own. There is no limitations here.


## Pull Request Guidelines

- Before opening a pull request, check if there is an open issue for the same purpose. If yes, try to link the issue to your pull request.

- In case of a modification, I will test the preset before merging it. I may not replace it with your proposal, but rather add it as an alternative version. All the contributions will be merged though.

- Before creating a new preset file, try to look if there is one already created. If so, it might be good to add your own preset into the same file. Please remember that each preset contains 8 slots and they might not be full.
For example: If you have a great new **John Mayer** preset, you can add to the existing one and put a nice and easy to recognize slot name.

## Beer

I don't expect to receive anything from this repo, as this is my playground to experiment sounds and save my presets for later. If I helped you enough, you can buy me a beer later! :beers:
